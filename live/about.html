		<h2>ARTV is a faux TV station.<br> The programme launched in 2014 and in the years since has enjoyed mild success and a dedicated audience.<br>While it is easy to say that it is just a bloke playing video games, I'd like to think that ARTV is an environment where<br> the game is just the excuse to veer off into more in-depth discussions with the audience on topics ranging anywhere<br> from politics to philosophy, to cinematography, to programming, to linguistics, etc. It also serves as a medium via<br> which many have found new and interesting works via recommendation from the host or other audience members.<br> A staple of the programme is a so called "blind playthrough", where the host and likely most of the viewers are<br> experiencing a work for the first time, stopping at opportune moments to remark upon anything that might have piqued<br> their interest. Anyone who aims to disrupt that is purged along the way violently and swiftly. There is only one simple rule: <br><br> If you don't like it - don't fucking watch it.</h2>
